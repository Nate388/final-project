The Program begins with a function, "endGame(go)". I wanted to print, "You loose, Game Over" whenever the player has lost. I used
this function to help automate that process. This function is used in lines 14, 26, 41, 52, and 64.

My next problem was figuring out how to make a game continue to move when a correct choice was made, and to loop all the back to the 
beginning when a wrong choice was made. I remembered that a "continue" statement could send a loop back to the beginning, but a "break" 
statement would require me to move out of the loop I wanted to return to. So using a "break" statement wasn't an option. 

I used a, "while True:" statement to deal in only specific values. I had hoped to make a more broad array of options for a player to 
choose from. But I could only manage a few. I used, "user = input()" to allow a player to type in thier own choices. In many lines for
the options I used, "if user == " ":" satements to program which options would loop and which options could move the program forward.
In the end, on line 61, I use a break statement to break the loop and end the game. 

There were a lot a features I wanted to implement that would improve the quality of the game such as, "else" statments so that when a 
player entered an answer that wasn't part of the choices, they would be sent back to the beginning of that choice. An actual end that
closed the program when the player reached the end of the code. And just more options and detail in the narrative to enhance the 
game.
