 # Instructions for Running my Program

Hey there. My program is really simple to run and play. All you need to do to start playing is to open the program and start reading. 

Follow the UPPERCASE WORDS when, "you need to make a choice." is presented to continue the game forward.

You don't need to include any outside programs to run this. Have fun and I welcome your feedback.
